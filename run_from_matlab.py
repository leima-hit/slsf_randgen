    Do not execute this script directly. This script will be exceuted by Matlab.

    When called (executed) by Matlab, this script will:

    1. Call csmith to generated a C program
    2. Build the generated program using GCC and then run it to determine if it terminates.
    3. Based on terminaion/non-termination of the program, a value is returned to Matlab.
    4. If the program terminates (in step 2), we concate the files 'randgen.c' and 'ee_post.c'
